TODO

- Let arenas own their memory.
- Implement a hash map.
- Test psh::sleep_milliseconds for Unix.
- Threading abstraction for Windows/pthreads.
- Shouldn't allocation procedures return FatPtr? I think this would be safer.
- Tests for `pth/algorithms.h`.
- Tests for `psh/stream.h`.
- Make arenas thread safe (opt-in overhead).
- Thread safe asynchronous stream functions.
