TODO

- #if defined(PSH_DEBUG) && PSH_DEBUG.
- Unordered/ordered container element removal.
- Drop support for short names.
- Implement a hash map.
- Threading abstraction for Windows/pthreads.
- Shouldn't allocation procedures return FatPtr? I think this would be safer.
- Tests for `psh/stream.h`.
- Make arenas thread safe (opt-in overhead).
- Thread safe asynchronous stream functions.
- Networking modules.
